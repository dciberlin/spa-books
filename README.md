The purpose of this exercise is to refresh basic react concepts.  
I am providing you with an array of data in `data/books.js`

Please create a react application from scratch, clean it up and create this book gallery.

Concepts that you should look up/refresh and use:

- List Rendering
- Class components
- State/setState
- Parent to child communication
- Props
- SCSS
- React events

If you are already familliar with fetching data from an API in react, then you are more the welcome to get real-time book data from the [New York Times API](https://developer.nytimes.com/).

Thank you
